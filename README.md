Why you need a server - There is a process to transpile the react javascript to the browser javascript 

Creating a React application 
In your terminal, type in
`npx create-react-app <project name>`

Replace `<project name>` with your desired name for your project 

1. Go to the directory in your terminal 
2. `npm run start`
3. For Gitpod users, you need to set up an `.env` file with the following content. The `env` file is in the same directory as `package.json`.

The content of the file is:
```
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=0 (This enables the hot reloading for gitpod users)

JSX - Look like HTML / Function like HTML but is a Javascript object

Any expression as long as there is a result, react will provide a reply
(i.e. anything inside the curly braces need to result into a value)
